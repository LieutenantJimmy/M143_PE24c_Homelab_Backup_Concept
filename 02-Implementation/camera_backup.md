## Primary Storage
- Enable **SMB1** feature on Windows Server (Feature on Demand).

$src = "D:\Cameras"
$dst = "D:\camera-backup"
robocopy $src $dst /MIR /R:1 /W:1 /FFT /Z /XA:H /XJ /NP /LOG+:C:\logs\cameras_robocopy.log
```
Schedule via **Task Scheduler** at 02:00 daily.

## Restore Test
- Delete a known clip from `$src`.
- Restore from `$dst` and verify playback.
- Screenshot before/after into `/03-Tests/camera-restore.md`.
